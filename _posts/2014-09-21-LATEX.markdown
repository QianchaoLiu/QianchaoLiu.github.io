In this short article, I will give a brief introduction to the grammar of LaTeX.   

###Structure of .tex file    
```\documentclass[opt,opt]{class}.``` uesd at the very beginning of a document. where `opt` can be:  

- Font Size:10pt/11pt/12pt etc.   
- Papar Size:leterpaper/a4paper etc.   
- Use two columns:twocolumn.   
- Set margins for two-sided:twoside.  
 
and `class` can be:   

- book/report/article/letter/slides   
   
```\input{inputfile.tex}``` used to include the file specifying ducument layout, which is optional.   
   
```\begin{document}``` and ```\end{document}``` uesd to start contents and end the document   
   
###Some other important things you should also know:
The test environment in this passage is [MacTex](http://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).   
To use LateX in [Sublime Text](www.sublimetext.com/), you can find steps of configuration at [here](http://economistry.com/2013/01/installing-and-using-latex-for-mac/).   
To use Chinese characters in your LaTeX, you can use **xelatex** Engine. Adding ```%!TEX program = xelatex``` at the beginning of your LaTeX code.
